\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_box}{Box}} \\*A 2D box (or square) that can interract with other objects }{\pageref{class_box}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_physics_game}{Physics\+Game}} \\*The class that manages the application window and game loop, along with scene selection and switching }{\pageref{class_physics_game}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_physics_object}{Physics\+Object}} \\*Represents the most basic form of an object that can be placed in the world. Designed to be inherited by other types, creating an instance of this on its own is heavily advised against. Also contains functions used for collision detection between different object types }{\pageref{class_physics_object}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_physics_scene}{Physics\+Scene}} \\*A scene to be updated and rendered by \mbox{\hyperlink{class_physics_game}{Physics\+Game}}. Holds, updates and renders a collection of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_physics_object}{Physics\+Object}} instances }{\pageref{class_physics_scene}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_plane}{Plane}} \\*A flat, infinitely long 2D surface that can interract with other objects }{\pageref{class_plane}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_rigidbody}{Rigidbody}} \\*An expansion of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_physics_object}{Physics\+Object}} class that adds all of the fundamentals of a non-\/static object such as position, velocity, rotation and mass. Similarly to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_physics_object}{Physics\+Object}}, this class is intended to be inherited, rather than instantiated as-\/is }{\pageref{class_rigidbody}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_sphere}{Sphere}} \\*A 2D sphere (or circle) that can interract with other objects }{\pageref{class_sphere}}{}
